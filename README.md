# Twisk

**Twisk** is a graphical interface tool that allows users to create and design worlds with ease. A *world* in Twisk is composed of various *stages*, each designed to allow the flow and circulation of *clients*. This setup provides a flexible, visual environment for modeling and simulating movements within a defined space.

## Features

- **World Creation**: Easily create custom worlds through a graphical interface.
- **Stage Composition**: Build worlds using multiple stages to represent different areas or checkpoints.
- **Client Simulation**: Enable client movement through the stages to observe circulation patterns.
